    "\n",
    "Knowing when to use exceptions can be tricky. As we can see, even from the trivial examples we've used here, exceptions, and code that handles exceptions, changes the flow control of a program. For example, when we `raise` an exception, execution either terminates, or passes to another part of the code. Following where execution is likely to switch to can make our programs difficult to read and debug. \n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, we should raise exceptions when the assumptions that we make about the input to our code -- that is, arguments passed to functions, or data entered by a user -- are broken. In the example above, we explicitly asked the user to enter a number: so, it is reasonable that an exception occurs if they enter something else. However, in the last code snippet, we raised an exception if the value they entered was equal to 10. This isn't a reasonable use case for exceptions: we should have used an `if` block instead."

    "Having broken the problem down, we can see that we have two main algorithmic problems:\n",
    "- calculating the average of a series of numbers; and\n",
    "- sorting a list of numbers, and printing the associated airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts of this that help us to determine the data structure that it would be best to use. Firstly, since we want to calculate the average of a series of related numbers, we'll want to use a separate list to store the temperatures associated with each airport:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "lax_readings = [26.2, 24.3, 21.1, 20.9, 25.4, 23.0]\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, since we have several airports, each with their own temperature readings, we could use a dictionary to store a mapping between the airport's code, and its temperatures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "temperature_readings = {\"LAX\": [26.2, 24.3, 21.1, 20.9, 25.4, 23.0],\n",
    "                        ...}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the overall data structure that we'll use in our program: using a list for the temperature makes it easy to calculate the average, and using a dictionary to store all of the readings lets us maintain the mapping between temperatures and airport codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to be able to sort the list of airports based on their average temperatures. To do that, we'll build a list, containing tuples, with the average temperature and airport code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "average_temps = [(28.4, \"LOS\"), (42.2, \"DWD\"), ...]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By using a list, we can sort `average_temps`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall plan\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly, we'll structure our solution like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read in the data file, and build our data structure\n",
    "- Calculate the average temperature for each airport\n",
    "- Print the list of airports and average temperatures, sorted by average temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "To build our solution, we'll write each of these components separately, and then combine them together. This is the bottom-up approach described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll write a function to read in a named data file, and return the dictionary in the format described:"
